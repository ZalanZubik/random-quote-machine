## About
This project was part of the Front End Libraries Projects on freeCodeCamp. The task was to build a random quote machine, which is functionally similar to the example project. The project had to pass 11 different tests. The quotes are stored on Github Gist in a JSON file, because it is easy to modify the list if necessary.

The website is called Daily Quotes. It randomly choose one from more than 50 inspirational quotes. You can tweet the one you like on Twitter.

The site is hosted by Netlify. [Check here!](https://daily-quotes.netlify.com/)
